    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A ribeye steak is a cut of beef from the rib section, known for its rich flavor and tenderness
        due to its high marbling. It's a popular choice for steak lovers, offering a good balance of 
        fat and muscle, making it a juicy and flavorful choice.

    <h2>Ingredients (8 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
        <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and 
            season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting pan. </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until rib eye is 
            reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center will read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium. </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
